This repository is for developing and testing some Bayesian distributional RL
algorithms.

** Quickstart

Clone the repository

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/maximerobeyns/bdrl
#+END_SRC

And install in development mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install -e .
#+END_SRC

Note: you may need to install third party dependencies first such as [[https://github.com/LaurenceA/bayesfunc][Bayesfunc]].

** Running an Agent

Agents are configured using [[https://github.com/google/gin-config][gin]] configuration files, so that the agent
configurations and hyperparameters are all in one place, in version control and
you don't have to pass long command line arguments. These configuration files
live in the =/configs= directory.

To run an agent, simply write a configuration file, and provide it to the
runner:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./main.py -c configs/dqn.gin
#+END_SRC
