  abstract = {The paper introduces the idea of Bayesian quantile regression employing a likelihood function that is based on the asymmetric Laplace distribution. It is shown that irrespective of the original distribution of the data, the use of the asymmetric Laplace distribution is a very natural and effective way for modelling Bayesian quantile regression. The paper also demonstrates that improper uniform priors for the unknown model parameters yield a proper joint posterior. The approach is illustrated via a simulated and two real data sets.},
